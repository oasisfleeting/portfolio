	<h3>Technology used in my portfolio</h3>
	<p>
		<i class="fa fa-quote-left pull-left"></i>
		My goal when building this portfolio was to show off as many languages as I could in a single web page (yes, this is just a single index.php page) and hopefully make them all work
		nicely with each other across all browsers, not an easy task I promise. Currently the technologies being used to power this webpage are:
		<h4>Client Side</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Normalize CSS</li>
			<li>Bootstrap CSS</li>
			<li>Font Awesome CSS</li>
			<li>JQuery Javascript</li>
			<li>Bootstrap Javascript</li>
			<li>Angular Javascript</li>
			<li>Modernizr Javascript</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Server Side</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>MariaDB</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>The top 10 sweet and sour of being a Freelance Web Developer</h3>
	<p>
		<i class="fa fa-quote-left pull-left"></i>
		I've been a web developer for nearly a decade and the majority of those years I've been freelancing. I've worked with and learned
		to code all of the top CMS' available today. I've seen the rise and fall of Mootools, JQueryTools, Mambo, Myspace, HTML4 and many other technologies.
		Being a freelancer is both sweet and sour. As I spent my first few years of web development freelancing,
		I spent a lot of my time learning more than I did coding. You have to learn how the business works, what real
		world customers are going to expect compared to what they expect to pay and how to actually express what you're
		offering them. On top of all that you have to actually do the work. In college my main Computer Science teacher always told me
		to "Take a business course" and I always thought to myself, "screw that", so because of that for me the hardest things over the
		years have been the following ordered from hardest to easiest:
	</p>
	<p>
		<ol reversed="reversed">
			<li>Reading and researching new technology.</li>
			<li>Adapting to the constantly changing and rapid pace of technology advancements.</li>
			<li>Practicing and adhering to best standards.</li>
			<li>Because I live Wichita, Kansas finding other developers to talk to was very difficult, so I always had to rely on chat rooms.</li>
			<li>Probing customers for what they want to accomplish and providing them what they envisioned.</li>
			<li>Articulating to the customer what is possible within their budget.</li>
			<li>Taxes and the IRS, more specifically paying in quarterly.</li>			
			<li>The act of actually finding work and paying clients.</li>
			<li>Finding paid work that is actually gratifying and enjoyfull to do.</li>
			<li>Estimating what the customer expects to pay.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		I've never found it difficult to provide customers what they want, but I constantly find it difficult to provide customers what I want.
		What I mean is, after spending <i>N</i> hours on a project it becomes a part of you and you see many ways that it can be improved, but alas,
		you're on a budget and there is no time for the fine tuning to make the project perfect, fine tuning that can be quite involved especially in
		larger projects. So if you want to feed your obsession with the little tweeks, bells and whistles that could make your project really great you have
		to take a cut in pay. Even if you provide a quality product to your customer deep down inside you know it's not the best it could be and a little piece
		of you dies inside.
	</p>
	<p>
		Underbidding on your projects can be disasterous. It's one of the things I do the most because of the paragraph above. I want to make the website
		better and better, and I come up short because of budgetary issues. The way to solve all of the biggest problems I had in the past is simple. Just
		talk to the customer and keep lines of communication open, it may be frustrating to stop everything you're doing to discuss their wants and needs but
		it will be worth it in the end because as long as you understand fully what the customer wants you will rarely come in over budget. Or better yet, if
		your budget can accomodate it, hire a project manager. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
