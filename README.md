A Portfolio for Oasis Fleeting
=================================================================================================

My goeal with this portfolio is to try and incorporate as many different programming languages as possible into a singlle file, both server side and client side while maintaining cross browser support.
[Not counting partials that will be called in using different jaxing methods]

I am putting this portfolio together because my current job has sold their web division
There are plans for easter eggs and other fun gimmicks. We'll see how those turn out. 

The base design of this portfolio was borrowed from [MARY LOU @ Manoela Ilic's project found here.](http://tympanus.net/Development/FullscreenLayoutPageTransitions)
https://github.com/codrops/FullscreenLayoutPageTransitions

She is an amazing designer where as I am more code oriented. Thank you Mary Lou!
