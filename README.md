A Portfolio for Oasis Fleeting
=================================================================================================

My goal with this portfolio is to try and incorporate as many different programming languages as possible into a singlle file, both server side and client side while maintaining cross browser support.
[Not counting partials that will be called in using different jaxing methods]

I am putting this portfolio together because my current job has sold their web division
There are plans for easter eggs and other fun gimmicks. We'll see how those turn out.
